Week 4 was algos & animations week, and we were tasked with building visualizations for sorting & search algorithms of our choice to help with our understanding of the algos and to practice making animations with Motion.

I was pretty excited about this week's materials and was having fun reviewing and building visualizations for heap sort and A* search. It had been a while since I saw these in school and it felt good to see them again and have a better understanding this time around as I worked with them more intimately and broke them down to make step-by-step visualizations.

But by midweek, I couldn't bring myself to finish the rest of the animations, as I got a call from my prediction markets project team. I've been working on a prediction markets arbitrage project since May, which started out pretty casually but after seeing some data from our prototype trading system we have some serious hope in it working and making money. Both prediction markets and high frequency trading are uncharted territory for me, and there is still a lot left to build and optimize and a lot of uncertainty, but I do miss the long focused days I spent working on it before the bootcamp started. So I was pretty conflicted, on one hand I really enjoy what I'm doing at the bootcamp and feel like I'm growing a lot as a full-stack AI engineer by learning new tools and working on new projects each week, on the other hand I feel kind of bad not contributing as much as I used to for the project and having not much meaningful updates to share at our meetings since I'm not spending enough time on it. I know how much more good work I can get done if I just focused on one thing, and I felt like I was falling short of my full potential at both my bootcamp and my project work. I had been thinking about this for a while by now, and thought I should talk about it with my instructors.

A bit to my surprise, my instructors are incredibly understanding and supportive of me working on the arbitrage project during the bootcamp, as long as I had conviction in it, since they see industry experience as a valuable learning experience. I was happy to hear this, but felt a bit uncertain too since success is not guaranteed and I'm pretty new to the space still. But nothing worthwhile is ever easy or certain, and I'm grateful for the chance to work on this project. I decided to not overthink this and to just give it my best shot. It would be great if we could get somewhere, but even if not I could still learn from the experience.

Starting this week I am officially working full-time on the prediction markets arbitrage project. Hope to make some good progress in the weeks to come.
