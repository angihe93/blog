Last week was week 2 of the Fractal AI Accelerator Bootcamp. (This is a weekly blog series. I wrote about the first week [here]())

In week 2 we dived into some current web & AI technologies including Next.js, Better Auth, Shadcn, Vercel AI SDK, and applied them to a chatbot app with persistent database and user authentication. We also got some practice writing authentication middleware with ElysiaJS (a modern and ergonomic web framework with excellent support for auto-generating swagger docs), and applied tRPC to some of our chatbot app routes to facilitate the building of typesafe APIs in our full-stack application.

This was a challenging week as we had to quickly learn the basics of all these tools and apply them in the daily assignments. Some of these tools are quite new and it felt exciting to be working with such modern tool stacks. At the same time, I felt like I was only working with the basics and there's still much more to explore. For instance, one of my instructors showed me the use of prefetching in his NextJS chatbot app, and I realized I hadn't thought about NextJS optimizations at all yet. Fortunately we get to continue working on our AI chatbot app this week and make it into a more polished product, so I'll have time to look into NextJS more such as deciding when to use client and when to use server-side rendering. I'm also planning to improve the UI/UX of my events chatbot app, by adding more styling, personalization, and usage tips, so it can look more production-ready, and become something people would want to use to find out about events happening nearby.

On Saturday we closed the week with a Vibe Coding Hackathon at the Fractal Tech HQ, which I unfortunately had to miss due to another project deadline, but it seemed like my classmates were able to vibe code some really cool apps, for example a poker odds trainer app and a pet rock simulation app with cool looking graphics.

I'm looking forward to building out my events chatbot app this week. While most of my previous dev experiences have been concerened with functionality and more backend-heavy, I appreciate good UI/UX and want to see if I can achieve it with my app. Small touches like prompt suggestions, markdown rendering, remembering info about the user such as their location, events interests etc would really upgrade the user experience. I hope to implement as many of these as possible this week. Looking forward to also see what my classmates build, so far I've heard there are games, language learning, and recipe and movie suggestions apps.
