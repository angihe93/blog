Today concludes the first week of the Fractal AI Accelerator Bootcamp, which is a 12 week in-person program focused on full-stack AI engineering.  

In week 1 we've already covered a lot of grounds, including creating a game app with Vite & Express (or Vite-Express), that connects to a database on Supabase, and implements web sockets for live move streaming on browsers.
We also learned how to use Tailwind CSS styling, practiced using Git branches, PRs, and code reviews, containerization with Docker, and deployment with Sevalla, Render, Vercel. We are also starting to learn Next.JS which is supposed to be good for componentizing frontend pieces and SEO optimization. This blog template is from Vercel and uses Next.js.

I made a Connect-4 game and it is [here](https://assignment4-multigame-oid6u.kinsta.app) if you'd like to check it out. I'm trying to implement an AI mode with the Minimax algorithm for computing optimal moves, however it is still under development. Since there can be many game states in the game tree, I'm starting with the 7-cell end case (a win can occur only with >=7 cells filled in). My end states and utilities seem good however I have not done enough testing, and the propagation from end states to earlier game states may have some issues with not enumerating all the outcomes, so my AI seem a bit dumb at the moment. I really thought I could implement this in 2 days, but I was too damn ambitious. I will keep trying though when I have time (my work in progress code is [here](https://github.com/angihe93/assignment4-multigame/blob/eb4b133733877db5dfa0634ab6f42c800fca1e69/src/game/ai/ai.ts), welcome any comments or suggestions). This has been a fun exercise in applying the AI theory I learned from school to practice. I learned about the subtleties of pass by reference and pass by value in TypeScript, as well as the benefits of a strongly typed language which not only prevents errors but also encourages clarity of thought, as one needs to think through the all the input/output types and interfaces.

Aside from the technical learnings, I really enjoy the sort of environment this bootcamp offers, where we have 1-2 lectures a day and then we get to spend the rest of the time coding. I can learn from the example repos and implement my own versions pretty fast, but I also hope to gain a broader and deeper understandings of web frameworks and technologies and when to use what. My instructors all seem like wizards and they really inspire me. My classmates inspire me too. Some people are fairly new to coding but they are asking questions, pushing through the challenges, and shipping just fine (vs. my younger, less experienced self would have been too embarrased and might have just given up).

I'm excited to see how much I can learn and grow during this bootcamp. On to week 2!
