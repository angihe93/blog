In week 3 of the bootcamp, we took a step back from learning new tools and instead focused on developing and polishing our chatbot app. I continued building my events chatbot app from last week, seeking to improve its functionality and UX.

Although I had a working chatbot last week that fetches events from the Google Events API and includes them in the response to user's events query, I realized it wasn't always picking up all parts of the user prompt when user asked about events (in particular it sometimes ignored the location if it was entered abbreviated which isn't great). It also wasn't rendering the events info in a nice way, and I wanted it to display them in a nice listed format like ChatGPT sometimes does. I also wanted to allow users the ability to view past chats, save events they're interested in, and navigate between different pages through a sidebar. 

While none of these appeared to be too difficult, working with an LLM does require some additional considerations that don't tend to come up when I'm building everything myself from scratch. For instance, I learned the importance of choosing a good prompt for the events tool integration so the LLM would pick up all relevant parts of the user input (namely event category, location, time) and fetch events from the API accordingly. I also realized it was important to include detailed prompt description in the place closest to where it is used rather than in the main LLM system prompt. Putting details about the events tool in the tool description made a huge difference in the output quality. 

Something I struggled quite a bit with was rendering events in a listed format in the specific way I desired. This is easy when I construct the list myself and can specify the HTML tags and styles as I wish. However the output of the LLM can be random and it might change its output structure or style from time to time, and so my code shouldn't depend on the LLM output style. I should have realized this sooner and used Vercel AI SDK's oject generation to generate reliable structured output for the events list, instead of parsing the LLM's markdown output and then formatting it into a list which can be buggy (the reason I didn't do this initially was because I wanted to keep all parts of the message, including the tool-call and non-tool call response content, but I realized I could have achieved this still by slicing the response content and using object generation on the tool-call content, then putting the response back together). The lesson here is, there's actually a lot of flexibility in working with AI, more than one would initially expect, one just needs to know all the tools that are available. 

Overall it was a good experience building with AI, and I realized how much functionality Vercel AI SDK provides out of the box. AI really can be leveraged to build many interesting and powerful apps, and I was mostly pleased with the way it handled user's events queries. I also used another LLM inside my app for slug generation (which takes the first meaningful user message in a chat and generates a short summary to display for the chat in the sidebar). These LLMs can be combined and composed to enable lots of functionality and create a beautiful app.

By the end of the week I achieved decently robust functionality with my events chatbot app, but I didn't get to spend as much time on styling as I had hoped. So my future plans are to add some styling framework and perfect the user experience, as well as exploring embedding search / RAG and how it can make the events search responses even more relevant and flexible. I will share a link to my app once it is more presentable and ready for the world to see. I believe the final product could inspire people to explore events nearby, meet people, and have some fun.

At our end of week demo I witnessed some impressive AI apps built by my classmates, including a museum curator that suggests art pieces based on user interests, a user-generated multi-player role-playing game, a language leaerning app with text and speech, a fitness trainer, a tennis coach, an astrology self-sexploration app, and many more. I loved seeing the creativity that came through everyone, and working alongside such talented people made me grateful to be part of this Fractal bootcamp cohort.
